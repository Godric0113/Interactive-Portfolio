    <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hey there, my name is Kayden Gilmore. I was born and raised in various different areas around the Pacific Northwest. I enjoy the same things that pretty much anyone from the PNW enjoys. I love to hike, mountainbike, offroad, camp and swim in any one of the many gorgeous lakes in my area. I have been working as a Massage Therapist for the past four years and have absolutely loved it. I loved having the opportunity to help people mitigate their chronic pain and stress. But unfortunately as the years as an LMT (Licensed Massage Therapist) have ticked by it has taken a toll on my body. That is what really pushed me in the direction of Web Developement. I have always been intrigued by computers and how they work, and the ability to write my own code to make an app, or a website has always been a goal of mine. I'm excited to see what the future holds and to continue learning and growing as a developer. </p>
