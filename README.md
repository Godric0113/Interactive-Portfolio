For this assignment I linked in bootstrap CSS to fast track the styling of my all three pages on my site as well as the nav bar. I then linked each of the pages to their corresponding tag in the nav bar by making them all nav items. For my portfolio page I linked in images that I have taken to give that page some content. I also added an alt atrtribute to each photo in the event the photo doesnt show up on the deployed site.
